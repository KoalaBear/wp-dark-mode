### **DEPRECATED.** Was Written for WordPress 3.7 on July 2019, now on GitHub for showcasing.
This plugin would make your site properly serve clients with dark mode enabled in their operating system automatically.
All you need to do is configure the dark mode colors (under your wp-admin panel), hit save and... you're in the dark mode evolution!
